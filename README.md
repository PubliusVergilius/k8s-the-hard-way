# Kubernetes - The Hard Way
### Inspired by https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way
The key differences of what I had implemented are the use of AWS, instead of GCP as the cloud provider. I also decided to make my own infrastructure definition using terraform, trying not to rely only on ad-hoc scripts. But the underlying ideas are the same.

## Project description
This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for someone looking for a fully automated tool to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.
